        <h2>Other key conventions and declarations</h2>
        <p>The International Year of Disabled Persons (IYDP) i 1981 was a starting point for the rights for persons with disabilities. IYDP called for a plan of action at the national, regional and international levels, with an emphasis on equalization of opportunities, rehabilitation and prevention of disabilities. Since then several key documents which promote the rights for persons with disabilities have been created.
            <br><br>The most important documents are:
    <ul><li>UN Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities (1993)</li>
        <li>World Declaration on Education for All (1990)</li>

        <li>The Dakar Framework for Action (2000)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Almost all countries (including Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania) have agreed and signed these declarations. Therefore it can be of interest for students, teachers, other people who are working with or for people with sensory impairment or people with sensory impairment themselves to know more about the background behind the situation of today.</p>
        <h3>UN Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities </h3>
        <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">The Standard Rules represent a strong moral and political commitment of Governments to take action to attain equalization of opportunities for persons with disabilities.</enable-quotebox>
        <p>The 22 rules from 1993 focus on <strong>"Preconditions for Equal Participation"</strong>, <strong>"Target Areas for Equal Participation"</strong> and <strong>"Implementation Measures"</strong>.</p>
        <p> They serve as an instrument for policy-making and as a basis for technical and economic cooperation.<br>In this context the target areas for equal participation should be of special interest. They are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accessibility</li>
                <li>Education</li>
                <li>Employment</li>
                <li>Income maintenance and social security</li>
                <li>Family life and personal integrity</li>
                <li>culture</li>
                <li>Recreation and sports</li>
                <li>Religion</li>

                <li><strong>Rule 5. Accessibility</strong><br>
                    States should recognize the overall importance of accessibility in the process of the equalization of opportunities in all spheres of society.

        <h3>Quality basic education for all</h3>
        <p>The Education for All movement is a global commitment to provide quality basic education for all children, youth and adults. The movement was launched at the World Conference on Education for All in 1990</p>
        <p>UNESCO, UNDP, UNICEF and the World Bank. Participants endorsed an 'expanded vision of learning' and pledged to universalize primary education and massively reduce illiteracy by the end of the decade.</p>
        <h3>World Declaration on Education for All</h3>
        <p>The participants in the World Conference on Education for All:</p>
        <ul><li>recalled that education is a fundamental right for all people regardless of sex, age, or where they live</li>
            <li>understood that education can help ensure a safer, healthier, more prosperous and environmentally sound world</li>
            <li>knew that education is an indispensable key to, though not a sufficient condition for, personal and social improvement</li>
            <li>recognized that traditional knowledge and indigenous cultural heritage have a value and validity in their own right and a capacity to both define and promote development</li>
            <li>recognized that sound basic education is fundamental to the strengthening of higher levels of education and of scientific and technological literacy and capacity</li>
            <li>recognized the necessity to give to present and coming generations an expanded vision of, and a renewed commitment to, basic education.</li>
        </ul>
        <enable-read-more label="Read the ten articles in the declaration:">
        <p>The declaration consists of ten articles:</p>
        <ol><li><strong>Meeting basic needs.</strong><br>Every person - child, youth and adult - shall be able to benefit from educational opportunities designed to meet their basic learning needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Shaping the vision.</strong><br>To serve the basic learning needs of all requires more than a recommitment
                to basic education as it now exists. What is needed is an "expanded
                vision" that surpasses present resource levels, institutional structures, curricula, and conventional delivery systems while building on the
                best in current practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Universalizing access and promote equity.</strong><br>Basic education should be provided to all children, youth and
                adults.</li>
            <li><strong>Focussing on learning.</strong><br>Whether or not expanded educational opportunities will translate
                into meaningful development - for an individual or for society -
                depends ultimately on whether people actually learn as a result of those
                opportunities, i. e., whether they incorporate useful knowledge, reasoning
                ability, skills, and values.</li>
            <li><strong>Broadening the means and scope of basic education.</strong><br>The diversity, complexity, and changing nature of basic learning
                needs of children, youth and adults necessitates broadening and
                constantly redefining the scope of basic education.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhancing the environment for learning.</strong><br> Learning does not take place in isolation. Societies, therefore,
                must ensure that all learners receive the nutrition, health care, and
                general physical and emotional support they need in order to participate actively in and benefit from their education.</li>
            <li><strong>Strenghtening partnerships.</strong><br>National, regional, and local educational authorities have a
                unique obligation to provide basic education for all, but they cannot
                be expected to supply every human, financial or organizational
                requirement for this task. New and revitalized partnerships
                at all levels will be necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Develop a supportive policy context</strong><br>Supportive policies in the social, cultural, and economic sectors
                are required in order to realize the full provision and utilization of
                basic education for individual and societal improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobilizing resources.</strong><br>If the basic learning needs of all are to be met through a much
                broader scope of action than in the past, it will be essential to mobilize
                existing and new financial and human resources, public, private and
                voluntary.</li>
            <li><strong>Strenghtening international solidarity.</strong><br>Meeting basic learning needs constitutes a common and universal
                human responsibility. It requires international solidarity and equitable
                and fair economic relations in order to redress existing economic disparities.</li>
