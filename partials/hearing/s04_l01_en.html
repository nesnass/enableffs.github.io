 <enable-quick-question e-question="Did you know...?" e-answer="Did you know that although education of the deaf is now a right in Uganda, only 10% of the hearing impaired children are enrolled for the primary education."></enable-quick-question>
<p>In Uganda 90 % of deaf children are not offered eduaction.<br>How will their future be?<br>The society becomes more and more independent of citizens who are well educated and hearing impaired citizens are a resource for the community which can be taken into use. The education of hearing impaired children can be done in two ways, either in a special school or the students can be included in an ordinary class together with hearing students. There are advantages and disadvantages to both education systems.</p>

 <h4>Excerpts from an interview with Moses Opio</h4>
 <p>"The best thing we need here is communication which is sign language. We intend/append? to bring all the parents with their 
 children to train them in sign language so that communication can be easier. Here we teach the teacher and the child and the 
 child and the parent.<br><br>These teachers we have here, not all of them are trained in special needs education. But we 
 endeavor, let me put it right, every Wednesday we convert(?) here for sign language training for everybody when wishes, 
 newcomers and their parents to acquire sign language training. For that, when this children, they are very well graduated 
 from here –from that level of craft. But I have to tell you that when I move out even in town, when I come across them in the
 workshops, they are living some better life as compared when they were living earlier back home. They are living their own life, 
 at least something can give some for daily living.<br><br>
The comparison between the hearing and the deaf, in the beginning it was difficult, but now that he way of communication is 
easier, the comparison is now becoming perfect in the sense that even the hearing themselves would judge their ear? They are
now helping us as interpreters because they can hear and they can sign. So it is making learning here almost becoming perfect. "</p>

<h3>Inclusion of students who are hard of hearing in an ordinary class</h3>
<p>If there is a student who is hard of hearing in your class, you should be aware of these adaptions of  the classroom environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sitting arrangement</li>
<li>Put light on the face of the  person who talks, backlight should be avoided</li>
<li>Be shure you get the child´s attention</li>
<li>Adjust your vocabulary</li>
<li>Show your face</li>
<li>Use various communication modes</li>
<li>The students should speak one at a time</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special schools for the deaf students</h3>
 <h4>Students learn sign language as their mother tongue</h4>
        <p>Sign language is a visual and gestural language based on the use of hands, eyes, face, mouth and body. It is visual language expressed with eye movement as well as facial expression. At Uganda school for the Deaf the pupils learn sign language as their mother tongue and english or other as their foreign language. It is impossible to use sign language with spoken language simultaneously; that is why sign language is still a challenge to the learners', education and parents'.</p>
<h4>Evaluation of deaf students</h4>
<p>The current National Primary Leaving Examination in Uganda demands the Deaf to be fluent in English before they are graded in a given subject, which situation ignores the fact that, learning any second language is influenced by ones mother tongue.</p>
<p>In their examination regulations "The Uganda National Examinations Board" allows deaf candidates to be guided by sign language interpreters and readers who are expected to tape record candidates responses.</p><p>Nevertheless, as a result, majority of the deaf adolescents end up failing exams and eventually dropping out of school.</p>
