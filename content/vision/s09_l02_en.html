        <h4>Guides</h4>
        <p>Some people use guide dogs instead of white canes. Guide dogs are trained and can navigate various obstacles. 
        However the challenge is that the guide dogs cannot interpret street signs, including traffic lights. 
        Furthermore guide dogs are restricted to some religious organizations. 
        Therefore, it seems difficult for people with visual impairment to be assisted by a dog. </p>

        <p>In African context the use of dog guide is minimal, it also have negative connotation. 
        People are more comfortable when assisted by their friends and family members for social reasons.</p>
